# Project 2 -- Grid Search and Object Dropoff (ROS 2)

This repository contains the scaffolded ROS 2 workspace for **ME:5195 --
Hand Built Robot, Project 2**.

Students are responsible for implementing the action server logic and
service-based task decomposition required to perform grid-based object
retrieval using the HiWonder Xarm 1S.

A **barebones action server scaffold** is now included in `xarm_nodes` as
`retrieve_items_action_server.py`.

# Packages

## 1️⃣ xarm_pickup_interfaces

This package defines all custom ROS 2 interfaces for the project. It does not contain any executable nodes.

### Action

`RetrieveItems.action`

#### Goal

    int32 num_items

#### Result

    int32 items_collected
    bool success
    string message

#### Feedback

    int32 current_box
    int32 items_collected
    string state

The action name expected in the graph is:

    retrieve_items

⚠️ Do not modify this action definition.

#### Service

A placeholder service interface is included, but is not configured. You must replace this with your own service(s) that will be implemented in your nodes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2️⃣ xarm_nodes

This package contains several Python nodes.

### pickup_gui.py
This is a tkinter-based action client GUI that will be used to initate the action (action client). When run, it:

-   Connects to action name: `retrieve_items`
-   Sends a goal (1--9 items)
-   Displays feedback
-   Allows cancellation

You can run the GUI by entering
``` bash
ros2 run xarm_nodes pickup_gui
```
into the terminal.

DO NOT modify the action client GUI.

### x_arm_hardware_node.py

This node interfaces with the physical Xarm hardware and should contain all hardware communications with the Xarm. It should contain:
-   Xarm object connected via USB
-   Servo commands
-   Gripper control
-   Motion execution logic

Students may modify or extend this node as needed.

### retrieve_items_action_server.py

This is a scaffolded ROS 2 action server for `RetrieveItems` (action name:
`retrieve_items`). It includes:

-   Node setup and action server creation
-   Goal callback, cancel callback, and async execute callback stubs
-   `MultiThreadedExecutor`-based main loop
-   TODO markers where students implement service calls and retrieval logic

You can run the action server by entering
``` bash
ros2 run xarm_nodes retrieve_items_action_server
```
into the terminal.

# What Students Must Implement

Students must implement:

-   The logic inside the scaffolded ROS 2 **Action Server** (`retrieve_items_action_server.py`) using the `RetrieveItems` interface
-   Service-based decomposition of tasks. These might include:
    -   Move to box
    -   Close gripper
    -   Check gripper
-   Continuous feedback publishing
-   Safe cancellation behavior

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Expected System Behavior

1.  User enters number of items (1--9)
2.  Clicks "Call Action"
3.  Robot:
    -   Searches grid
    -   Grasps object
    -   Transports to dropoff
    -   Repeats until goal satisfied
4.  GUI displays live feedback
5.  Cancel button stops execution safely

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Dependencies

-   ROS 2 (Humble or newer recommended)
-   rclpy
-   tkinter (usually included with standard Python installs)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Academic Integrity

All code must be your team's original implementation.\
You are responsible for understanding and debugging all code submitted.
